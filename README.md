**Current State:**

This Restaurant Management System is created to track the day-to-day management of The Grill House, chain of restaurants in different cities in the USA.
Currently they have a paper-based system for the same and this has many issues. The orders were taken by the waiters on paper and a paper-based bill was presented to the customers.

All the bills were entered into an excel sheet by the manager at EOD to know the total sales and item wise sales for the day. Then reports were generated on excel to know trends and details like daily, weekly, and monthly sales. Which dishes were popular and which werenâ€™t doing so well?

Restaurants need a system that will allow them to easily update their menu. They currently do not have a system that recognizes the different types of users such as managers, waiters, etc. and they would like to be able to limit the access of some options of the system to certain users.

**Future State**: Client has given the following requirements:

1.System should be able to create a menu.Each item should be saved in the system along with its price. This menu should be created and edited by the managers only. They should be able to add new items, delete existing items, as well as create new menus from scratch.The menu should be categorized into following sections:

Starters,Soups,Main Course,Desserts and Drinks

2.Waiters and managers should be able to search items in the menu using the search facility.

3.Every waiter and manager should have access to the software. Waiters shall use this system for generating the bill table wise. Every bill shall be tagged to the waiter generating it and the table number. Waiters cannot edit the menu. Waiters shall use the system only to generate bills.

4.The system should be able to reserve tables. This reservation would be done by managers only. The waiters shall not seat anyone on the tables reserved. The waiters shall look into the software to determine which tables need to be reserved. The table layout is to be stored in the system.

5.Management wants certain reports at the end of the day. Please give the report formats for the following reports:

a).Total sales of the day by dine in customers

b).Total sales of the day by home delivery customers

c).Total sales of the day (home delivery and dine in customers consolidated)

d).Name the top 10 most sold dishes for the day

e).Total sales every weekend (to be done by inputting the dates)

f).Total sales every month (to be done by inputting the dates)

g).List of dishes not sold in the current month (this is to phase out dishes that customers are not ordering)

h).Total sales across all cities

i).Total sales for each city

6.Login for waiters, managers, and James Oliver (CEO). Change password facility to be offered.

7.Customers can pay by cash or card. There should be a payment gateway on the system.

8.System should be able to generate the bill.

9.James Oliver (owner) would like a feedback form (paper) to be given to every customer. This form shall capture details like name, address, mobile number, email, date of birth, anniversary dates of the customers, and their feedback. These details shall be added by the manager manually into the system.

This capstone project had four tasks:

1.**Business analysis** 

This task involves stakeholder identification, developing both the current ("as-is") and future process maps, and outlining business features and requirements. These requirements were then categorized into functional and non-functional types. Additionally, the scope of the project was clearly defined by listing in-scope and out-of-scope items. Mockups or wireframes were designed for two selected features to visualize the proposed solutions.

2.**Agile scrum concepts using Jira**

In this segment, Agile methodologies were applied using Jira. The task involved creating a comprehensive product backlog and developing user stories, each accompanied by detailed acceptance criteria to ensure clarity and alignment with business needs.

3.**Tableau**

This task  centered on the development of interactive dashboards for senior management.The dashboard provided insights on sales of restaurants for the last six months and to show which zone (Zone 1, 2, 3, or 4) has highest sales.

4.**Excel**

This task involves cleaning and transforming dataset and followed by the creation a bar graph restaurants in cities like San Jose, Madison, and New York showing the sales.
